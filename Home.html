                <p>Dear friends,<br>
    
                    A few days ago we had the largest event of the past year. The premiere of God’s Living Treasures,
                    Amazing Animals of Alaska Volume 3. In conjunction with Biblical Discipleship Ministries, we’ve been
                    working on the production of this for 2 years, and hundreds of people joined us for the documentary
                    premiere here at the Wonders Center in Lewisburg, TN.<br>
                    <br>
                    I was joined by Dr. Jobe Martin, Buddy Davis, Dr. Jim Johnson, and others involved. This is the final
                    film in the Alaska series, and we are excited to announce that it is available now as a digital
                    download, and also available for preorder on DVD, expected to ship in just a few weeks.
